# Audio_Visualizer
visualizing musical characteristics with signal processing on Arduino 

This project requires that the Open Music Labs implementation for the FHT is included as an Arduino library. More details can be found here:

The goal of this project is to implement a spectral analyzer, a robust tuner, and eventually a transcriber for dictation and to become a musical training assistant.
